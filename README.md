# ui-workbench

A place to explore Web UI.

## Getting Started

Before installing, make sure that you have Pnpm installed.

```
pnpm --version
```

Run the install command at the root.

```
pnpm i
```

This will install all necessary packages to work with.

This repo is managed with monorepo provider Turborepo. To run `artstation` within archives, run the following.

```
pnpm dev --filter artstation
```

This will tell Turborepo to search and start the project with the same name.

## Researches

I used this repo mainly for researching UI related topics such as

- SPA components
- Animations
- Fonts
- Frameworks
- Latest trends
